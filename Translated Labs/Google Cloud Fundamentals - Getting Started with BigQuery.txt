Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with BigQuery

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Load data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery.
- Perform a query on the data in BigQuery.

##1. Load data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery
/* activate ssh then create datatset named "logdata"
bq mk logdata

/* create table "accesslog" into "logdata" database and load data

bq load --autodetect logdata.accesslog gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/access_log.csv 

/* To view the table properties (Schema)
bq show logdata.accesslog

##2. Perform a query on the data using the BigQuery to query the accesslog table.

/* BigQuery discover the schema when load the data, the hour of the day during which each web hit arrived is in a field called int_field_6.

bq query "select int64_field_6 as hour, count(*) as hitcount from logdata.accesslog group by hour order by hour"


##3. Perform a query on the data using the bq command

bq query "select string_field_10 as request, count(*) as requestcount from logdata.accesslog group by request order by requestcount desc"

/* The bq command then performs the action requested on its command line.
